  <h2>About this project </h2>
  <p>These projects has being developed in order to practice and fix my learning in react framework. Feel free to help me with suggestions or comments, i will aprreciate it.</p>
  <b><p>Why im not using my personal GitHub ?</p></b>
  <p>Since i wish to be able to have access in different locations to my projects, the GitHub offers a convenient tool called Codespaces, with it i can create an virtual machine with Visual Studio and can access all my projects whenever and where i want to.</p>
  <p>But since this tool is avaiable only to Organizations, i've create one Organization of my own called MyLearningJourney to be able to keep up learning everwhere. </p>
