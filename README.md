  <h2>About this project </h2>
  <p>Despite having a degree in software engineering, currently im a programming rookie in the path to become a Javascript Full Stack Developer.</p>
  <p>Right after my graduation I was dedicating myself to a non-technology-related business that didn't work out.</p>
  <p>And since i’ve started to studying programming again, I slowly fell in love with it, specially to Front-End</p>
  <p>I’m a really honest person, with creative skills to solving problem and a little bit perfeccionist.</p>
